## Third-Party Services

### Apple Services

Park Explorer uses standard Apple frameworks and services:

- **MapKit**: For displaying maps and park locations (uses Apple Maps)
- **UserDefaults**: For storing preferences locally on your device
- **OSLog**: For app debugging (logs remain on device only)

These services operate under Apple's privacy policies and terms of service.

### External Links

The app provides links to official state park websites for additional information. When you click these links:
- You will leave the Park Explorer app

### Map Features

Park Explorer displays park locations on maps but:
- Does **not** track your current location
- Does **not** request location permissions
- Does **not** collect or store location data
- Only displays static park coordinates from the park database

If you choose to get directions to a park, Apple Maps will open and handle navigation according to Apple's privacy policy.

## Children's Privacy

Park Explorer does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app is designed to be safe for users of all ages.

## Data Security
